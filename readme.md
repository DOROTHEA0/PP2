## Introduction 
According to VolunteeringACT, the ACT “has the highest volunteering rate nationally with 36.8% of (the) population actively volunteering. These volunteers contribute over $1.5 billion to the ACT economy every year” [1]. Existing volunteers are important in several sectors, including in conservation efforts, from biodiversity monitoring to habitat restoration. Nevertheless, increasing the number and diversity of community members participating in environmental monitoring and conservation is key for addressing pressing issues such as pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental justice [2,3]. Despite digital technologies present an opportunity to increase participation in environmental volunteering [4,5,6], it can be still challenging for people to find volunteering opportunities, as well as to map and measure the collective contribution of volunteers. A number of strategic citizen science documents developed recently in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, as well the “Australia Strategy for Nature 2019-2030”, highlight a number of needs that could be covered with state-wide or nation-wide environmental volunteer platforms.
